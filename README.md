Project 5


*note: Even though I wanted to minify the code to get an exceeds expectations for app architecture, I chose to leave it unminified so the grader could read my code/comments to understand what I did

Description: My favorite restaurants marked on a google map. Additionally, there is a list of them on the right hand side. At the top is a search bar to help you find a desired location.

Api used: Google maps, google streetview, flickr

Features: A search bar that when used filters both the list on the right and markers on the map. Clicking a marker or restaurant in the list will generate a collage of flickr images that replaces the map.
To get rid of the collage click the clear button. In the list, there is a personal description of the place and a picture of the restuarant via google streetview.

How to use: Click on any item in the list or marker on the map to display pictures from flickr. Use the search bar to filter markers on the map and list. Clicking clear resets the search, clears
the flickr collage on screen (if something was clicked), and resets all the markers and items in the list. In the event that there are problems (i.e. internet goes down) there is error handling
and a message will pop up alerting the user there is a problem.
